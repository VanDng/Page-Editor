I saw projects implementing a form to enter scripts, or a bit better with a small html-based rich text editor.

I am bored of that, so I made Page Editor integrated with Visual Studio Code!
  
In-use features:
- [X] Auto reload the browser on script change.
- [X] Auto create connection between the browser and VS Code. Open VS Code and start writing right away!
